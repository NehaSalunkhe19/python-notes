## What is a Variable?
A variable is used to store data in memory.
It acts like a container for values.

## Example
x = 10
name = "Neha"
is_active = True

## Rules for Naming Variables
- Variable name must start with a letter or underscore (_)
- It cannot start with a number
- Only letters, numbers, and underscore are allowed
- Variable names are case-sensitive

### Valid Variable Names

## Assigning Values
Python allows multiple assignments.

a = b = c = 10
x, y, z = 1, 2, 3

## Type of Variable
Python is dynamically typed.
You do not need to specify the data type.

x = 5        # int
x = "Hello"  # string

## Check Variable Type
type(x)
