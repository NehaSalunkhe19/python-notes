# Data Types in Python

## What is a Data Type?
Data type defines the type of value a variable holds.

## Built-in Data Types in Python
Python provides the following built-in data types:

- Numeric (int, float, complex)
- String (str)
- Boolean (bool)
- List
- Tuple
- Set
- Dictionary
- NoneType

---

## Numeric Data Types

### int
Used to store whole numbers.

Example:
x = 10
y = -5

### float
Used to store decimal numbers.

Example:
pi = 3.14

### complex
Used to store complex numbers.

Example:
z = 2 + 3j

---

## String (str)
Used to store text.

Example:
name = "Neha"

---

## Boolean (bool)
Used to store True or False.

Example:
is_student = True

---

## List
- Ordered
- Mutable (can be changed)

Example:
numbers = [1, 2, 3]

---

## Tuple
- Ordered
- Immutable (cannot be changed)

Example:
colors = ("red", "green", "blue")

---

## Set
- Unordered
- No duplicate values

Example:
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3}

---

## Dictionary
Stores data in key-value pairs.

Example:
student = {"name": "Neha", "age": 22}

---

## NoneType
Represents no value.

Example:
result = None

---

## Check Data Type
Use type() function.

Example:
type(name)

## Interview Questions

**Q1. What is mutable and immutable data type?**  
Mutable data types can be changed (List, Set, Dictionary).  
Immutable data types cannot be changed (int, float, tuple, string).

**Q2. Difference between List and Tuple?**  
List is mutable, Tuple is immutable.

**Q3. Which data type does not allow duplicate values?**  
Set does not allow duplicate values.
